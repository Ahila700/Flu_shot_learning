Competition for DrivenData to Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines
--
I want to analyze the given data to try and create a modelt that can accurately predict whether or not people got the Flu-shot/H1N1 vaccine in the 2010 range. I will be using information such as social and economic background as well as demographic, opinions on the vaccination in general (whether they believe it causes illness or how effective it is) etc. And using that information with the result which is whether or not people got the vaccine to be able to generate a model that can most accurately predict if someone did or did not get the vaccine. 

I will start with analyzing the data with visualizations and looking at more information in the data. Handling possible missing values without necessarily removing them entirely. And slowly wittling down to the most influential information to the final result to run a more simplified and effective model.
